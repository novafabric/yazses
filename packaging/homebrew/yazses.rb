  caveats <<~EOS
    YazSes listens for the dictation hotkey using macOS's Accessibility
    API. After install, grant access in:

        System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → YazSes

    On first dictation, macOS will also prompt for Microphone access. Allow it.

    Default hotkey: Right Option. Configurable in:
        ~/Library/Application Support/yazses/config.toml

    This is an unsigned developer preview. If macOS refuses to launch the
    app, right-click YazSes.app and choose Open the first time.
