# YazSes

**Hold a key → speak → release.** YazSes is an open-source, **offline** voice‑dictation daemon for **Linux, macOS, and Windows**. It transcribes your speech locally with [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) and types the result into whatever window has focus — plus voice commands and macros. **No cloud. No API key. No subscription. Nothing leaves your machine.**

[Get it on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/yazses/){: .btn }

## Install

```sh
# Any OS with Python ≥ 3.11
pipx install yazses

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novafabric/yazses/main/install-apt.sh)

# Linux (any distro) — strict snap; keystroke injection works on X11
sudo snap install yazses
```

Then:

```sh
yazses doctor     # check mic, injection backend, permissions
yazses enroll     # calibrate your microphone (~30 s)
yazses start      # start the dictation daemon
```

Hold the hotkey (Space on Linux, Right Option on macOS, Right Ctrl on Windows), speak, release — the text appears in the focused app within about a second.

## What it does

- **Offline dictation** — type into any focused app with on-device faster-whisper (CPU, int8). No GPU needed.
- **Voice commands** — a regex grammar (plus an optional ~0.5B SLM router) maps phrases to editor/terminal key sequences: *"undo that"*, *"save file"*, *"go to line 42"*, *"run the tests"*, *"rename this to user_id"*.
- **Macros & personal vocabulary** — define multi-step commands and teach YazSes your mis-heard words.
- **Dysfluency-Friendly Mode** — opt-in collapse of stutters/repeats for stuttered or dysarthric speech.
- **Self-improving** — opt-in, encrypted on-device learning corpus; `yazses tune` proposes accuracy fixes from your own corrections.
- **Accessibility** — VAD calibration, mic-level tuning, and EMG (muscle-sensor) trigger support.

## When *not* to use it

YazSes is **not an LLM agent** — it dictates text and runs editor/terminal commands; it does not browse, reason over your files, or hold a conversation. It uses CPU faster-whisper (a cloud service may still win on raw accuracy for a noisy mic), ships English-tuned `*.en` models by default, and is desktop-only.

## How it works

```
Hold hotkey → record audio → VAD gate → faster-whisper (CPU)
            → clean + disfluency filter → command grammar (Tier 1 regex,
              optional Tier 2 SLM router) → dictate? type it · command? send keys
```

## FAQ

**Does it work without internet?** Yes — transcription runs locally; nothing is sent anywhere by default.

**What GPU do I need?** None. It runs on CPU; 4 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB comfortable.

**Does it work on Wayland?** Yes via the pipx install (uses wtype/ydotool). The strict snap injects on X11; for Wayland prefer pipx.

**Is it a replacement for Talon?** YazSes focuses on offline dictation plus a practical command grammar. Talon has far more advanced scripting. They can coexist.
