# Installing YazSes on Linux (Python v0.4 line)

This guide installs the Python daemon as a global command and starts it
automatically at login. It targets the reliable batch (transcribe-on-release)
configuration. Tested on X11 + PipeWire.

## 1. Prerequisites

**The easy way — one command does all of this:**

```bash
yazses setup    # installs deps, joins the input group, sets up ydotoold (Wayland)
# then log out and back in (the input-group change needs a fresh login)
```

`yazses setup` is idempotent (safe to re-run) and provisions everything below
automatically. The rest of this section explains what it does, for when you want
to do it by hand or understand the pieces. Verify anytime with `yazses doctor`
(want `[OK] Keyboard capture`, `[OK] Microphone`, `[OK] Injection`).

```bash
yazses doctor   # after install: checks injection backend, mic, input group, ydotoold
```

**Manual route — install every runtime dependency in one command** (the APT
`.deb` pulls these in automatically, so skip this if you used `install-apt.sh`):

```bash
sudo apt install libportaudio2 xdotool ydotool wtype xclip wl-clipboard pipx
```

What each is for:

| Package | Role | Needed when |
|---|---|---|
| `libportaudio2` | Audio capture — `sounddevice` loads it at import | **Always** (else the daemon crashes on start: `OSError: PortAudio library not found`) |
| `xdotool` | Text injection (X11) | X11 sessions |
| `xclip` | Clipboard fallback (X11) | X11 sessions |
| `wtype` / `ydotool` | Text injection (Wayland) | Wayland sessions |
| `wl-clipboard` | Clipboard fallback (Wayland) — provides `wl-copy` | Wayland sessions |
| `pipx` | Installs the `yazses` CLI | If installing via `pipx` |

Installing all of them makes YazSes work whether you log into X11 or Wayland —
at runtime YazSes auto-selects the right backend (`inject/auto.py`). You also
need membership in the **`input`** group (step 1a) and a working microphone
(PipeWire/PulseAudio/ALSA).

### 1a. Add yourself to the `input` group (required)

The hold-to-talk hotkey is read directly from the kernel input devices
(`/dev/input/event*`), which are owned by the `input` group. If your user is not
in that group the daemon **cannot detect the hotkey** and dictation never starts
(`yazses doctor` reports `[FAIL] Keyboard capture: denied`).

```bash
sudo usermod -aG input "$USER"   # add yourself to the input group
```

Then **log out and back in (or reboot)** — group membership only refreshes on a
new login session. Confirm it took effect:

```bash
id -nG | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -x input   # should print: input
yazses doctor                          # should show [OK] Keyboard capture
```

Do this **before** starting the daemon (step 3).

### 1b. Wayland keystroke injection — `ydotoold` (GNOME/KDE Wayland)

How text gets typed depends on your session:

| Session | Injector | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| X11 | `xdotool` | works out of the box |
| Wayland — wlroots (Sway, Hyprland, …) | `wtype` | works out of the box |
| **Wayland — GNOME / KDE** | **`ydotool` + `ydotoold`** | `wtype` is **blocked** by Mutter/KWin; `ydotool` injects at the kernel `/dev/uinput` level and is the only reliable option |

On GNOME/KDE Wayland you must run the `ydotoold` daemon, or injection fails with
`failed to connect socket … .ydotool_socket`. `yazses setup` configures this for
you; to do it manually, install the user service:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp /usr/lib/systemd/user/ydotoold.service ~/.config/systemd/user/ 2>/dev/null \
  || curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MSKazemi/yazses/main/contrib/ydotoold.service \
       -o ~/.config/systemd/user/ydotoold.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now ydotoold.service
ls -l /run/user/$(id -u)/.ydotool_socket   # socket should now exist
```

`ydotoold` runs as your user (no root) because `/dev/uinput` is owned by the
`input` group (step 1a). After this, `yazses doctor` shows `[OK] Injection` and
`[OK] ydotoold`.

## 2. Install the CLI globally

The project ships as a Python package. Install it isolated so `yazses` works
from anywhere. Either tool works — `uv tool` if you already use `uv`, otherwise
`pipx`:

```bash
# Option A — uv (recommended if uv is installed)
uv tool install --force /path/to/yazses

# Option B — pipx
pipx install /path/to/yazses
```

This installs four commands: `yazses`, `yazses-daemon`, `yazses-tray`,
`yazses-agent` into `~/.local/bin` (make sure that's on your `PATH`).

> If an old `alias yazses=...` exists in your shell rc pointing at a previous
> build, remove it so the installed binary is used.

## 3. Start at login (systemd user service)

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/yazses.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=YazSes offline voice dictation daemon
After=graphical-session.target
PartOf=graphical-session.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/yazses-daemon
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=2
# X11 injection (xdotool) needs the display + auth cookie of the active session.
# Match these to your session — check with: echo $DISPLAY ; echo $XAUTHORITY
Environment=DISPLAY=:1
Environment=XAUTHORITY=/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority
Environment=PATH=%h/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Enable and start it:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now yazses.service
systemctl --user status yazses.service     # should be "active (running)"
```

> **Important:** `DISPLAY`/`XAUTHORITY` must match your live session or injected
> text goes nowhere. On X11 they are usually `:0`/`:1` and a GDM `Xauthority`
> path. On Wayland, set `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` instead and use `ydotool`/`wtype`.

## 4. Use it

1. Focus any text field.
2. Hold the hotkey (default `right_alt`), speak, release.
3. The transcript types in once.

```bash
yazses status      # state, hotkey, model, backend
yazses logs        # recent diagnostic log (metadata only)
```

## 5. Tune the silence threshold

If dictation does nothing and `yazses logs` shows `Silent audio -- discarding`,
your speech is below the VAD gate. Measure and set it:

```bash
yazses mic-level --set      # records ~4s; writes a fitting vad_threshold
systemctl --user restart yazses.service
```

Re-run whenever your speaking volume changes (e.g. quiet late-night dictation).

## 6. Manage the service

```bash
systemctl --user restart yazses.service    # after a config change
systemctl --user stop yazses.service       # stop
systemctl --user disable --now yazses.service   # stop + remove autostart
journalctl --user -u yazses.service -f     # live logs via journald
```

Config lives at `~/.config/yazses/config.toml`. See the
[CLI reference](cli-reference.md) for all commands.

## 7. Troubleshooting: the hotkey does nothing

If holding the key records nothing (no transcript, no overlay reaction), run the
health check first — it now pinpoints every common cause in one shot:

```bash
yazses doctor
```

Look for these lines and act on any that are not `[OK]`:

- **`Hotkey device: bound to virtual device …`** — the daemon is listening on an
  injector's virtual device (e.g. `ydotoold virtual device`) instead of your real
  keyboard, so your keypresses are never seen. Make sure you are in the `input`
  group (`groups | grep input`; if missing, [§1a](#1a-add-yourself-to-the-input-group-required),
  then log out and back in) so the real keyboard is readable. Fixed in v1.3.3+,
  which skips virtual devices automatically; older builds need an upgrade.
- **`systemd unit: ExecStart=… does not exist`** — the service points at a binary
  that isn't there (a leftover from a different install method), so it crash-loops
  with `status 203/EXEC` and `yazses start`/`restart` silently start nothing. Point
  the unit's `ExecStart` at your real binary (`which yazses-daemon`) and
  `systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart yazses`.
- **`Install: multiple yazses on PATH …`** — you have more than one copy installed
  (e.g. apt + pipx + uv tool). Keep one and uninstall the rest so an upgrade can't
  leave you running stale code: `pipx uninstall yazses`, `sudo apt remove yazses`,
  or `uv tool uninstall yazses` as appropriate.
- **`Keyboard capture: FAIL`** — you are not in the `input` group; see
  [§1a](#1a-add-yourself-to-the-input-group-required).

If `yazses logs` shows `Silent audio -- discarding`, the key *is* working but your
speech is below the VAD gate — see [§5](#5-tune-the-silence-threshold).

> **Tip:** manage the daemon with `systemctl --user restart yazses` when a systemd
> unit exists; mixing `yazses start` (detached) with a systemd unit can leave two
> daemons fighting over the hotkey, or none running at all.

## 8. Voice-activity overlay

The overlay draws neon "sonar" rings near the cursor that pulse with your voice
while you dictate. It is **on by default** and works out of the box: PySide6 is
part of the base install (and bundled in the snap), so there is no extra step.
The PySide6 wheels need glibc ≥ 2.28 (Ubuntu 20.04+); on older distros the
daemon logs a one-line hint and keeps dictating.

The daemon then auto-launches `yazses-overlay` on start when a display is present
and terminates it on shutdown. If PySide6 isn't installed the daemon logs a
one-line hint and keeps dictating — nothing breaks. To turn the overlay off, set
`[overlay] enabled = false` in `~/.config/yazses/config.toml`. Run `yazses
overlay` yourself to preview it.

**Transparency note (X11):** the see-through glow needs a compositing window
manager. If you run a bare WM without one, install `picom`:

```bash
sudo apt install picom && picom -b      # or enable your DE's compositor
```

Without a compositor the rings still render, just on a small opaque panel.

To autostart it as its own user service instead of letting the daemon spawn it,
create `~/.config/systemd/user/yazses-overlay.service` with
`ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/yazses-overlay`, `Environment=DISPLAY=:0`, and
`After=yazses.service`, then `systemctl --user enable --now yazses-overlay`.
