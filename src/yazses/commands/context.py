"""Context-Primed Dictation & Commanding core (v2.0.0 Wave A, ADR-v2-004).

Pure logic that turns transient, already-consented desktop signals (active window
title, current selection, clipboard, editor LSP symbols) into a compact term list
for Whisper's ``initial_prompt``, and helps resolve deictic command references.
Reading the signals is platform-specific and lives in ``platform/*``; this module
only processes strings handed to it, and NEVER stores them.
