"""Punch-In (P1 core) — correct a span by re-speaking just that phrase.

The user re-speaks a short phrase; this locates the closest-matching word span in
the recent dictation buffer and proposes replacing it with the respoken text —
like punch-in recording in a DAW. Per the evidence (Suhm 2001: pure respeak fixes
only ~35% and re-fails on retry), the design surfaces the top 2-3 aligned
candidates for the user to confirm rather than auto-splicing; the daemon/UI layer
(re-record capture + confirm + keyboard fallback) is P2.

Alignment uses stdlib ``difflib`` (no third-party dependency). Spec:
design/specs/punch-in.md.
