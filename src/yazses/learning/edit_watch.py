"""Opt-in post-dictation edit capture (signal b).

After YazSes injects dictated text, the user often fixes a misrecognition in
place ("thetext" → "the text"). YazSes cannot see that edit — it does **not**
log keystrokes (that would be invasive and violate ADR-011). The only
non-keylogging way to observe it is to ask the *editor* what the text looks like
now. :class:`EditWatcher` does exactly that: a short delay after injection it
reads the editor region back and, if it changed into a near-by correction,
records it.

The editor I/O is injected as a ``read_current_text`` callable so the diff logic
is fully unit-testable without a live editor. Currently wired to Neovim via a
``--listen`` socket; other editors can supply their own reader.
